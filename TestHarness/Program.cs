  [[Overview]]
    [[Zifika]] is a symmetric cipher construction based
    on deterministic [[Traversal]] over a two-
    dimensional permutation grid. [[Cipherbytes]]
    are the result of relative traversal distances rather than
    transformed plaintext values.

  [[Core Concepts]]

    [[Plainbytes]]
      [[Plainbytes]] are byte values consumed during
      [[Traversal]]. They include user input bytes
      and injected bytes such as [[PrefixBytes]] and
      [[StartLocation]] encodings. All [[Plainbytes]]
      are processed uniformly.

    [[Cipherbytes]]
      [[Cipherbytes]] are the distance values between
      successive traversal landing positions within
      a single 256-byte key row. They do not represent
      transformed plaintext values.

    [[Traversal]]
      [[Traversal]] is the deterministic process of
      advancing through the [[ZifikaKey]] grid using
      jump values, landing positions, and offset
      emission.

    [[JumpStream]]
      The [[JumpStream]] is a deterministic sequence
      of jump values derived from [[ZifikaKey]] and
      per-execution inputs. Jump values are
      independent of [[Plainbytes]].

    [[LandingSemantics]]
      Each jump produces a landing position within
      the current key row. A [[Cipherbyte]] is emitted
      as the forward wrapped distance to the target
      column selected by the current [[Plainbyte]].

    [[RowAdvancement]]
      After each landing and emission, traversal
      advances to the next key row deterministically,
      modulo the total row count.

  [[Start Location And Prefixes]]

    [[StartLocation]]
      The [[StartLocation]] is a per-execution value
      that establishes the initial traversal origin.
      Its encoded bytes are consumed as [[Plainbytes]]
      across multiple traversal steps.

    [[PrefixBytes]]
      [[PrefixBytes]] are a per-execution sequence of
      injected [[Plainbytes]] consumed before user
      input. They are indistinguishable from user
      input during traversal.

  [[Input And Plainbytes]]

    [[Input]]
      [[Input]] to [[Zifika]] is an ordered sequence of
      bytes. Any byte that participates in traversal
      is a [[Plainbyte]].

    [[PlainbyteSources]]
      [[Plainbytes]] include user input bytes,
      [[PrefixBytes]], [[StartLocation]] bytes, and
      other injected per-execution values. Source
      does not affect traversal behavior.

  [[Integrity]]

    [[IntegritySeal]]
      The [[IntegritySeal]] is an optional per-
      execution mechanism that binds ciphertext
      validity to traversal replay. The seal is
      mapped under the same traversal machinery.

    [[FailClosedBehavior]]
      If [[IntegritySeal]] validation fails during
      decryption, traversal replay halts and no
      plaintext output is produced.

  [[Keys]]

    [[ZifikaKey]]

      [[WhatItIs]]

        [[SerializedForm]]
          A [[ZifikaKey]] is represented as a two-
          dimensional grid of bytes. Each row is
          exactly 256 bytes wide and is a permutation
          of values 0–255.

        [[ExecutionForm]]
          In execution form, a [[ZifikaKey]] exists as
          traversal-defining state. It deterministically
          defines jump generation, landing behavior,
          and offset emission.

      [[WhatItIsNot]]

        [[SerializedForm]]
          A [[ZifikaKey]] is not a number, scalar, or
          algebraic structure. It does not encode
          block structure or plaintext-dependent
          state.

        [[ExecutionForm]]
          A [[ZifikaKey]] is not a reversible transform,
          block cipher state, or stream cipher seed.

    [[MintingKey]]

      [[WhatItIs]]

        [[SerializedForm]]
          A [[MintingKey]] is a composite key artifact
          containing complete [[ZifikaKey]] base data
          and minting authority material.

        [[ExecutionForm]]
          In execution form, a [[MintingKey]] exists
          as traversal-defining state plus attestation-
          generating capability.

      [[WhatItIsNot]]

        [[SerializedForm]]
          A [[MintingKey]] is not a public key,
          [[VerifierKey]], or standalone signing key.

        [[ExecutionForm]]
          A [[MintingKey]] cannot decrypt or verify
          ciphertext and cannot validate ciphertexts
          minted by other keys.

    [[VerifierKey]]

      [[WhatItIs]]

        [[SerializedForm]]
          A [[VerifierKey]] is a composite, secret key
          artifact containing [[ZifikaKey]] base data
          and verification-only authority material.

        [[ExecutionForm]]
          In execution form, a [[VerifierKey]] exists
          as derived traversal state plus attestation-
          verification capability.

      [[WhatItIsNot]]

        [[SerializedForm]]
          A [[VerifierKey]] is not a [[MintingKey]] and
          does not contain minting authority material.

        [[ExecutionForm]]
          A [[VerifierKey]] cannot generate mint-bound
          attestations or mint acceptable ciphertext.

  [[MintVerifyMode]]

    [[Overview]]
      [[MintVerifyMode]] separates the capability to
      mint acceptable ciphertext from the capability
      to decrypt and validate ciphertext.

    [[RelationshipToSymmetricOperation]]
      [[MintVerifyMode]] builds directly on symmetric
      [[Traversal]] without altering cipher semantics
      or integrity behavior.

    [[IntendedProblemSpace]]
      [[MintVerifyMode]] applies where creation
      authority and consumption capability must be
      separated, such as controlled distribution or
      delegated decryption.

    [[WhatItIsNot]]
      [[MintVerifyMode]] does not define a new
      asymmetric primitive and relies on an existing
      asymmetric signing primitive with non-
      reversible verification roles.
